# The Roadmap

1. Copy previous EFI to another directory, so to work not from EFI partition
2. Download new [Open Core Release](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)
3. Update The Config
4. [Sanity Checker](https://opencore.slowgeek.com/) for The Config
5. Update files: `*.efi` by taking them from [Open Core Release](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)
6. Update files: `*.kexts` by recompiling new versions


# Update Files

Downloaded new versions of:

- [Open Core](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)
- Get `Docs/Sample.plist` from the archive

# Update The Config

1. [OC Config Compare](https://github.com/corpnewt/OCConfigCompare)
2. Compare them visually in XCode and move reordered strings or copy new ones, so it would be easier with `vimdiff`
3. Compare them with `vimdiff`

## OC Config Compare

I did `git pull` to update the repository, since I had it cloned already. As the tool can get the latest Sample from GitHub, I can download OC Release after finishing with the config.

My differences were:

```
Checking for values missing from User plist:

[+] config.plist -> Kernel -> Quirks - Missing Key: DisableRtcChecksum
[-] (next version) config.plist -> Misc -> Security - Missing Key: BlacklistAppleUpdate
[+] config.plist -> Misc -> Security - Missing Key: BootProtect
[?] config.plist -> NVRAM -> Add - Missing Key: 4D1FDA02-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B30102
[?] config.plist -> NVRAM -> Block - Missing Key: 4D1FDA02-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B30102
[+] config.plist -> UEFI - Missing Key: APFS
[+] config.plist -> UEFI - Missing Key: ProtocolOverrides
[+] config.plist -> UEFI - Missing Key: ReservedMemory

Checking for values missing from Sample:

[?] Sample.plist -> DeviceProperties -> Add - Missing Key: PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)
[?] Sample.plist -> DeviceProperties -> Block - Missing Key: PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1b,0x0)
[?] Sample.plist -> Misc -> Boot - Missing Key: HideSelf
[+] Sample.plist -> UEFI - Missing Key: Protocol

```

I use this list only to double-check on the differences mentioned by the tool.


## Xcode, configs side by side

Here I compare only for removed and added elements, not comparing the entries. The comparing step is for `vimdiff`.

1. ACPI
 - Add — keep original, replaced it in Sample
 - Block — same
 - Patch — same
 - Quirks — same

2. Booter
 - MmioWhitelist — same
 - Quirks — same (RebuildAppleMemoryMap is YES for me, while NO in Sample)

3. DeviceProperties
 - Add — keep original
 - Block — keep original

4. Kernel
 - Add — that‘s where my kexts are — keep original
 - Block — same
 - Emulate — same
 - Patch — different, skipped for later
 - Quirks — almost the same, new is: `DisableRtcChecksum`, copied to my config

5. Misc

- BlessOverride — same, both empty
- Boot — same, but different order in Sample, reordered my config according to it
- Debug — keep original
- Entries — same
- Security — same, keep original, added new Key: BootProtect, cannot find Key: Blacklist Apple Update, seems like that's because the tool gets a newer Sample.plist
- Tools — keep original

6. NVRAM
 - Add — keep original
 - Block — keep original
 - Rest — keep original

7. PlatformInfo — keep original

8. UEFI
 - APFS was added, copied to my config
 - Protocols became ProtocolOverrides
 - ReservedMemory was added, copied to my config
 - Drivers — removed ApfsDriverLoader.efi since it's integrated now
 - ProtocolOverrides — added Key: AppleRtcRam, from Sample


Hint:

- Number of Keys are shown in Value column, while in Xcode; so to quickly compare the changes


## vimdiff

- To skip to the next difference — `]c`
- To apply the difference from the right (remove on the left) — `do`
- To apply the difference from the left (remove on the right) — `dp`

Assuming the original is on the left and the new is on the right:

- `do` to apply new
- `dp` to keep original


This step I do with [OpenCore Desktop Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/) opened next to me, comparing the differences, checking whether I should keep things I decided to keep.



# [Sanity Checker](https://opencore.slowgeek.com/)

A great tool to check your config. Then you may share your result with a unique link. All your private information — such as your Serial, etc. — excluded automatically.

[My result was confirmed to be working](https://opencore.slowgeek.com/?file=haswell058Xcw1l8&rs=haswell058), so I copied the new files to my EFI partition and pushed it to my git. You may find a public duplicate of my EFI partition [in my GitHub](https://github.com/walteweiss/Hackintosh-GA-Z87MX-D3H).



# Drivers aka `*.efi`

- `EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.efi` from [Open Core Release](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)
- `EFI/OC/OpenCore.efi` from [Open Core Release](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)
- `EFI/OC/Drivers/OpenRuntime.efi` from [Open Core Release](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases) — 
- `HFSPlus.efi` stays the same



# Kexts

I cloned [Lilu-and-Friends Tool](https://github.com/corpnewt/Lilu-and-Friends), and made `git pull` to update (was up to date for me).


## My Kexts

- 06 — AppleALC.kext
- 31 — IntelMausiEthernet.kext
- 33 — Lilu.kext
- 45 — SMCProcessor.kext
- 45 — SMCSuperIO.kext
- 43 — USBInjectAll.kext
- 45 — VirtualSMC.kext
- 52 — WhateverGreen.kext

You need to enter numbers of your kexts and the tool does the rest: compiles the kexts and opens a directory with zip archives. My numbers are: 06, 31, 33, 43, 45, 52, then B to Build Selected.

I got this result:


```
Succeeded:

    AppleALC v1.5.0
    IntelMausiEthernet v2.5.1d1
    Lilu v1.4.4
    USBInjectAll v0.7.1
    VirtualSMC (All Tools) v1.1.3
    WhateverGreen v1.3.9

Failed:

    None
 
Build took 1 minute, 35 seconds.

```

Only AppleALC is new, all the rest are all the same versions. I updated just one kext.

# No longer relevant

1. This time I didn't need [AppleSupportPkg](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleSupportPkg/releases), since it contains just:

- AudioDxe.efi 
- VBoxHfs.efi

which I don't use (I use HFSPlus.efi).

2. Also I didn't need `EFI/OC/ApfsDriverLoader.efi` from [AppleSupportPkg](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleSupportPkg/releases) — now it's integrated into the current 0.5.8 version
