# Update from 0.5.8 to 0.5.9

## The Process in a Nutshell

1. Update `kexts`
2. Update `efi` files
3. Update `config.plist`


# My Process

Even though my EFI partition is a git repository, I work from a duplicate directory in my Documents, because if anything wrong will happen (e.g. no electricity for a while, which happens in my current area during the heavy storms), I’ll have more mainintenance than I want to. I finish, then I push my changes to the repository and update my EFI partition with `git pull`. It’s an extra work, but it saves me some nerves.

1. `git pull` my Documents/EFI directory, just to confirm it’s all new
2. Update `*.kexts` by recompiling new versions with [Lilu-and-Friends Tool](https://github.com/corpnewt/Lilu-and-Friends). 

2. Download new [Open Core Release](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)
3. Update The Config
4. [Sanity Checker](https://opencore.slowgeek.com/) for The Config
5. Update files: `*.efi` by taking them from [Open Core Release](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)

# 1. Update Kexts

## [Lilu-and-Friends Tool](https://github.com/corpnewt/Lilu-and-Friends). 

- If not installed `git clone https://github.com/corpnewt/Lilu-and-Friends.git` 
- If installed update the tool with `git pull` on a repository.

## My Kexts

- 06 — AppleALC.kext
- 31 — IntelMausiEthernet.kext
- 33 — Lilu.kext
- 44 — USBInjectAll.kext
- 47 — SMCProcessor.kext
- 47 — SMCSuperIO.kext
- 47 — VirtualSMC.kext
- 52 — WhateverGreen.kext

You need to enter numbers of your kexts and the tool does the rest: compiles the kexts and opens a directory with zip archives. My numbers are: 06, 31, 33, 43, 45, 52, then B to Build Selected.

I got this result:


```
Succeeded:

    AppleALC v1.5.1
    IntelMausiEthernet v2.5.1d1
    Lilu v1.4.6
    USBInjectAll v0.7.1
    VirtualSMC (All Tools) v1.1.5
    WhateverGreen v1.4.1

Failed:

    None
 
Build took 2 minutes, 1 second.


```

Some kexts aren’t new, but I replaced all the files, just in case.

# 2. Update `*.efi` Files

Get [Open Core Release](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases).

Update the files:

- `EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.efi`
- `EFI/OC/OpenCore.efi`
- `EFI/OC/Drivers/OpenRuntime.efi`

New file:

- `EFI/OC/Bootstrap/Bootstrap.efi`

Stays the same:

- `HFSPlus.efi`


# 3. Update My Config

Get `Docs/Sample.plist` from [the archive](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases).

1. [OC Config Compare](https://github.com/corpnewt/OCConfigCompare)
2. Compare them visually in XCode and move reordered strings or copy new ones, so it would be easier with `vimdiff`
3. Compare them with `vimdiff`

## OC Config Compare

I did `git pull` to update the repository, since I had it cloned already. As the tool can get the latest Sample from GitHub, I can download OC Release after finishing with the config.

My differences were:

```

Checking for values missing from **User plist**:

config.plist -> ACPI - Missing Key: Delete
config.plist -> DeviceProperties - Missing Key: Delete
config.plist -> Misc -> Debug - Missing Key: ApplePanic
config.plist -> Misc -> Debug - Missing Key: SysReport
config.plist -> Misc -> Security - Missing Key: BlacklistAppleUpdate
config.plist -> NVRAM - Missing Key: Delete
config.plist -> NVRAM -> Add - Missing Key: 4D1FDA02-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B30102
config.plist -> UEFI -> Quirks - Missing Key: DeduplicateBootOrder
config.plist -> UEFI -> Quirks - Missing Key: TscSyncTimeout

Checking for values missing from **Sample**:

Sample.plist -> ACPI - Missing Key: Block
Sample.plist -> DeviceProperties - Missing Key: Block
Sample.plist -> DeviceProperties -> Add - Missing Key: PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)
Sample.plist -> Misc -> Boot - Missing Key: HideSelf
Sample.plist -> NVRAM - Missing Key: Block
Sample.plist -> UEFI -> Output - Missing Key: DirectGopCacheMode
Sample.plist -> UEFI -> Quirks - Missing Key: RequestBootVarFallback

```

I use this list only to double-check on the differences mentioned by the tool.

## Xcode, configs side by side

Here I compare only for removed and added elements, not comparing the entries. The comparing step is for `vimdiff`.

1. ACPI
 - Add — keep original, replaced it in Sample
 - Block
 - Patch
 - Quirks

2. Booter
 - MmioWhitelist
 - Quirks

3. DeviceProperties
 - Add
 - Block

4. Kernel
 - Add
 - Block
 - Emulate
 - Patch
 - Quirks

5. Misc

- BlessOverride
- Boot
- Debug
- Entries
- Security
- Tools

6. NVRAM
 - Add
 - Delete — new `rtc-blacklist`, entry. I added that from the Sample.plist to my config.
 - Rest

7. PlatformInfo

8. UEFI


## vimdiff

- To skip to the next difference — `]c`
- To apply the difference from the right (remove on the left) — `do`
- To apply the difference from the left (remove on the right) — `dp`

Assuming the original is on the left and the new is on the right:

- `do` to apply new
- `dp` to keep original


This step I do with [OpenCore Desktop Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/) opened next to me, comparing the differences, checking whether I should keep things I decided to keep.



# [Sanity Checker](https://opencore.slowgeek.com/)

A great tool to check your config. Then you may share your result with a unique link. All the private information — such as your Serial, etc. — excluded automatically.

[My result was confirmed to be working](https://opencore.slowgeek.com/?file=haswell059IK9Fcx&rs=haswell059), so I copied the new files to my EFI partition and pushed it to my git. You may find a public duplicate of my EFI partition [in my GitHub](https://github.com/walteweiss/Hackintosh-GA-Z87MX-D3H).
