# Guide

Used [Dortania’s Guide for OC Update](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/post-install/update.html), few notes to those who needs more information.

Downloaded new versions of:

- [Open Core](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)
- [AppleSupportPkg](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleSupportPkg/releases)

# Update Files

## Drivers aka .efi

- `EFI/OC/ApfsDriverLoader.efi` from [AppleSupportPkg](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleSupportPkg/releases)
- `EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.efi` from [Open Core](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)
- `EFI/OC/OpenCore.efi` from Open Core
- EFI/OC/Drivers/OpenRuntime.efi from Open Core: since 0.5.7 that’s a new file, I removed `FwRuntimeServices.efi` (Screenshot to update in the wiki)
- `HFSPlus.efi` stays the same


## ACPI aka .aml

I had `SSDT-EHCx_OFF.aml` but it’s no longer in the [Getting started with ACPI](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/) guide. Does it mean I have to remove the file both from my `ACPI` directory and OC’s `config.plist`? Should I update these files at all? I assume I’m not.

Found it in the guide, it’s: 

>Preferred alternative over renaming EHCI for setting up USB correctly on pre-Skylake systems. This can be avoided if your BIOS supports EHCI-Handoff, this can be done during post-install though

I assume I can keep these files till the point I update my BIOS, if that’ll ever happen.

## Kexts

- Cloned two repos: [Lilu-and-Friends](
) and 

### [Lilu-and-Friends Tool](https://github.com/corpnewt/Lilu-and-Friends)


It requires me to enable white theme, which burns my eyes, otherwise I cannot see any kexts, since it’s black-on-black. You can change colours later, but… too much to bother with, for one time (just having two — dark and light — themes would be great).

#### My Kexts

- 06 — AppleALC.kext
- 31 — IntelMausiEthernet.kext
- 33 — Lilu.kext
- 45 — SMCProcessor.kext
- 45 — SMCSuperIO.kext
- 43 — USBInjectAll.kext
- 45 — VirtualSMC.kext
- 52 — WhateverGreen.kext

Succeeded:

    AppleALC v1.4.8
    IntelMausiEthernet v2.5.1d1
    Lilu v1.4.4
    USBInjectAll v0.7.1
    VirtualSMC (All Tools) v1.1.3
    WhateverGreen v1.3.9

### [KextExtractor](https://github.com/corpnewt/KextExtractor) Tool

Lilu-and-Friends made zip archives of compiled kexts. Which KextExtractor can place into EFI directory, but since it’s my first time, I’m doing all the work on EFI directory copied to my Documents directory, which the script cannot do. 

What does it do after all, just copy files? I can do it myself then. Replaced all the kexts manually.

# Compared Configs


## With `OC Config Compare`

Downloaded [OCConfigCompare](https://github.com/corpnewt/OCConfigCompare) and compared my configs.

My differences were:

  #######################################################
 #                 OC Config Compare                   #
#######################################################

Checking for values missing from User plist:

## With `vim diff`

- To skip to the next difference — `]c`
- To apply the difference from the right (remove on the left) — `do`
- To apply the difference from the left (remove on the right) — `dp`

Assuming the original is on the left and the new is on the right:

- `do` to apply new
- `dp` to keep original
