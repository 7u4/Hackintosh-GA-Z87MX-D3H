# Horrible Sound

Sound has a lot of noises, impossible to listen to music. Reboot fixed that.


# Apple ID issue

## No password

When I logged into my user, macOS asked for Apple ID password, to confirm setting my account. 

>This Mac can’t connect to iCloud because of a problem with [Apple ID].
>Open Apple ID preferences to fix this problem.

After I entered the password for like 10 times, it added emails (for the Mail.app, accounts section) I no longer want in my system. I didn’t add them, they just were here. 

That happened to every user on my system.


## Other Issues

- Optimise Mac Storage is suddenly on
- For some reason now I have two iMacs with identical serial numbers. Nothing has changed in my hardware since my usage of the computer.
