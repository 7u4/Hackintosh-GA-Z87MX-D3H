# BT keyboard and Trackpad don’t work

So I cannot login, since only my wired mouse works. Reboot doesn’t fix it.

The issue was resolved by itself the very next day. 


# Suggestion

Maybe the reason this happened is because I had my desktop powered for a long time, but shut off. So my Airport Module was powered on for quite a long time. Maybe it went to sleep, somehow?
